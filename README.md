Create the GitHub commit activity graph using this data: https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/stats/commit_activity

Notes:
Commit color density should be relative to the highest single day activity and broken into 4 quarters.

For example, if the highest single day activity is 84 commits the breakdown of color density would be:

- Darkest: 63-84 commits
- Darker: 42 - 62 commits
- Base: 21 - 41 commits
- Lighter: 1 - 21 commits
- Lightest (empty): 0 commits

## How to run this project locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
